#ssh and private key set up Andrew Mallett

  # Allow Root login
	# Change PermitRootLogin to 'no' in /etc/ssh/sshd_config ## as root 
  
  # configure ssh alias
    # as ROOT, create 'config' in /home/tomgdow/.ssh
	# config as follows
	
	Host tomgdigo
        HostName 46.101.11.172
        User tomgdow 
        Port 22

ssh-keygen -t rsa

ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub tomgdigo #goodie goodie

add public key to .ssh/authorized_keys (and away you go)
on windows, store keys in .ssh 

scp exptscp  tomgdigo:/home/tomgdow/

ssh-agent
eval $(ssh-agent)  ## see here: https://superuser.com/a/707645/704294
ssh-add 

Notes on setting up ubuntu on windows ('native' ubuntu on windows-10)
did not login as root (this did not work)
created config in .ssh as per above.
Then changed permissions:
chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r config
ssh-kegen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub tomgdigo #goodie goodie 
now everything working. pub key added to authorized keys on tomgdigo
to get rid of passphrase requiement
ssh-agent
eval $(ssh-agent)
ssh-add
ssh tomgdigo # Works perfectly
