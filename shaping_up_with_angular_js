# A simple definition of  AngularJS.
# :wqA client-side JavaScript Framework for adding ineractivity to HTML

#A directive is a marker on an HTML tag that tells Angular to run or
referrence some JavaScript code

#Controllers are where we define our application behaviour 
by defining functions and values


#1 Directives.  HTML Annotations that trigger JavaScript behaviour
#2 Modules.  Where our application components live
#3 Controllers Where we add our application behaviour
#4 Expressions. How values get displayed within the page :wq

# Expressions define a two-way binding. This means that expressions
# are re-evaluated when a property changes. 

# ng-init allows us to evaluate an expression in the current scope.

<div ng-class="{active : tab===1}"></div>

#Sending in object as argument to ng-class.
# Passing in, as a key, the NAME of the classs we want to add.
# And as a value, an expression to evaluate. 
# If expression is true, the class will be appended to the element
# Otherwise do nothing. 

#Note the following  goodie
<section ng-controller="PanelController as panel">

#ng-submit allows us to call a function when the form is submitted. 
#
#Validation in AngularJS 
#1 Turn off HTML validation - 
<form name="reviewForm" ... novalidate>
#2 Mark fields that are required by adding the 'required' atttribute.
 <select ng-model="review.stars" required>
 # add some development code
 <div>Review form is {{reviewForm.$valid}}</div>
 #The dollar sign means we are referencing a built-in property of the form. 
 
 <form name="reviewForm" ng-controller="ReviewController as reviewCtrl" ng-submit="reviewForm.$valid && reviewCtrl.addReview(product)" novalidate>

#Source before typing email
<input name="author" class="ng-pristine ng-invalid" /> 
#Source after typing
<input name ="author" class="ng-dirty ng-invalid"/>
# Sourc after typing with valid email
<input name ="author" class="ng-dirty ng-valid" /> 
#All angular magic by default added by AngularJS

# ng-include
 <h3 ng-include="'product-title.html' ">

 # Why the double-quotes insdie the single quotes?
 # ng-include is expecting  a variable with the name of the file to include
 # To pass the name directly as a string, use single quotes. 
 
 # Note that ng-include makes an ajax request for the ng-included file
 # after the page (index.html, say) has loaded. 
 
 # But a custom directive is the preferred way to load a template. 
 
 # Angular Services
 
 $http
 $log
 $filter

 # $http
 #1 Can use $http as a function with an options object
 $http.get({method: 'GET', url : '/products.json'});
 Or, use one of the shortcut methods ..
 $http.get('/products.json', {apiKey: 'myApiKey'});
 # Both of these method return a promise
 # can call callbacks such as .success()  and .error()
 
 # Funy array syntax and dependency injection
 app.controller('SomeController', ['$http','$log', function($http, $log) {
 });

 # Dependency Injection
 #1 When Angular loads, it creates an injector.
 #2 When the built in services load, they register with injector
 #3 When the app loads, the controller registers with injector and 
 # psst -  I need the following services. 
 # When page loads and the controller is used the injector grabs
 # the services  that are needed and  injects them in as arguments
 # to a function.  Dependencies are injected in as arguments. 
 # $http can also do the following:
 $http.post('/path/to/resource.json', {params: 'value'});
 $http.delete('path/to/resource.json');
 #OR
 $http({method: 'OPTIONS', url: '/path/to/resource.json'});
 $http({method: 'PATCH', url: '/path/to/resource.json'});
