1. Create a backup of the corrupt directory:
cp -R bin bin-backup
2. Make a new clone of the remote repository to a new directory:
git clone ssh://tomgdow@tomgdow.com/home/tomgdow/bin.git bin-newclone
3. Delete the corrupt .git subdirectory:
rm -rf bin/.git
4. Move the newly cloned .git subdirectory into foo:
mv foo-newclone/.git foo
5. Delete the rest of the temporary new clone:
rm -rf foo-newclone
