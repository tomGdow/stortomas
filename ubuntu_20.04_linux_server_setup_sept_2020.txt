Set up Ubuntu 20.04 Server (ubbu)

Methods (Virtual Box Set Up)

    iso:
	    downloaded ubuntu server 20.04  // On Lenovo, due to hash-mismatch error
	    ubuntu-20.04-live-server-amd64.iso

    name: tomgdow
    username: tomgdow
    password: My
    server-name: ubbu  (used to 'talk' to other machines)

    2MB ram
    50G hard disk
	
	During setup, installed ssh-server
	    git-hub ssh key (allowing authentication)
		
	
	Also installed (during setup)
	    postgres
		powershell  //didnt install !!
		doctl (digital ocean command line interface) 
		stress-ng
		
Methods (Post reboot)

    Working from:
	    /stortomas/linux_server_pluralsight_log
	
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade 
  
    sudo apt install lynx
	sudo apt install ripgrep

    cd /etc/ssh and fixed banner as per Jim Pickrell, Pluralsight (linux_server_pluralsight_log)
	Fixed as per previous method
	sudo service ssh restart
	ssh tomgdow@localhost
	All OK! 
	
    sudo apt install apache2
	
    did NOT install vsftp
	
	sudo apt install sqlite
	sqlite
	.quit
	
	sudo apt install mysql-server
	sudo mysql_secure_installation
	Root password  My
	
	Installed postgresql as per digital ocean proceduce
	(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04)
	did not take further than 
	sudo -i -u postgres
	psql
	        
	
	sudo apt install nodejs
	sudo apt install network-manager
	sudo apt remove network manager
	did NOT change ip to 172.28..  (in fact did, but didnt work!)
	
	git is installed! 
	
	192.168.1.6
	
	$ sudo bash
    # mkdir /etc/gcrypt
    # echo all >> /etc/gcrypt/hwf.deny
	
	
   sudo apt install encfs
   
   All ok but WOULD NOT allow decryption of visible folder, saying password mismatch
   Using encfs -f -v  encodeddir decrypteddir on encryped folder with known password ('tom')
   traced this down to hash mismatch!!
   At this stage, turned OFF Virtual Machine Platform (in 'Turn Windows Features On/Off') 
   All Ok now!
