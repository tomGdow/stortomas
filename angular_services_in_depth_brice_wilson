# Angular Services in Depth.

# There are 5 Different ways to create a service in Angular.

# Services and Providers

# There are 5 functions that may be used to create a service in Angular
# All these fns may be called on the built-in provide service
# All are also exposed on the module object as a convenience

#1 The most fundamental service provider function is 
provider()
# Allows you to explicitly create a configurable provider
# object 
# Three of the remaining 4 functions all internally call
# the provider. Just shortcuts if you don't need all the
funtionality provided by provider.
#2 The first of these is factory(). The first of the
#wrapper funtions. Will probably become your primary 
#service creation function. 
#3 service().  Just a simple wrapper around the factory function
# When you call the service function it will internally call
# the factory function, which will then call the provider function.
#4 The value function is similarly a wrapper around the factory function.
#5 The constant function. This one looks similar but is actually
#fundamentally different. It does NOT call the factory function
# or the provider function. 

# Services are designed to be injected into the other components
# of your application. Their creation is very much part of Angular's
# dependency injection system. 
## Injectable services are known as providers. 
# So before a service is created there must be a provider that
# knows how to create this. 
# The $provide service is used to do that. It is one of the services
# that ships with Angular. It has several components to register
# components with the Angular injector. 
# Once registered, the injector knows how to find the correct instance
# and pass it as a parameter to other components needing them. 

#The basic process of creating a service is that a provide SERVICE
# creates a provider which contains a function that is used to
# create a service. 

# The first function on the $provide service we'll look at is the
# provider() function. 
# This is the most fundamental way to create a service.

$provide.provider('books', function () {
		this.$get = function () {
		var appName = "Book Logger";
		return {
			appName: appName
	};
}

# All other methods, except constant, are wrappers around the provider 
# service

# Using $provide.provider()
# call the 'provider' function on the $provide service
# in above example, the name of service is 'books'
# and the name of the provider will be booksProvider

# The NUMBER ONE RULE for using a provider function is that
# function you provide to it must contain a property named
# $get
# The function assigned to that property is the function that
# will be called by Angular to create your service. 
# The service will then be represented by the return value
# of that function. 
# Creating services withe the provider function is a little more 
# complicated than the other techniques we'll look at. 
# The benefit it offers in exchange for that complexity is the ability
# to configure the underlying provider for your services.  
# None of the other service creation functions allows you to do this. 
# GO TO DEMO. 

# 'Brice' 2.04 of creating services
# "I am using Angular's controllerAs syntax, so I am not injecting
# a scope" !!

# You don't have to inject the provide service into the 
# config function and then call provider directly on the $provide
# service.
# As a convenience, the provider function is also exposed as a function
# directly on the Module object.
#
# angular automatically appends the word 'Provider' to the name
# of the service you specify when creating the underlying provider for
# the service
#
# Factory and Service Functions

#1  Using $provide.factory()
# Simple version of provider when addtional configuration is unnecessary. 
# Registes a service factory function that will return a service instance
# The following is the Angular Source code for the factory function

function factory(name, factoryFn, enforce) {
    return provider(name, {
		    $get : enforce !== false ? enforceReturnValue(name, factoryFn) : factoryFn
		});
	}

#2 using $provide.service()
# Calls factory function which calls provider function
# Executes constructor function with "new" operator
# Angular source code for $provide.service()

function service(name, constructor) {
    return factory(name, ['$injector', function ($injector) {
		    return $injector.instantiate(constructor);
		}]);
	}

# The service function is just a very thin wrapper around the
# factory function.  The only difference is that the function
# you pass to the service method will be treated as a constructor
# function and called with the javaScript 'new' operator
# It uses the instantiate method of the injector to pass
# to call the function you pass to the service method.
# The instantiate method will then use the new operator
# to execute the function that creates the service. 

# You would use the service method instead of the factory method
# if you specifically needed your function to be treated as
# a constructor and called witht the 'new' operator. 
# There are several reasons why you might want that behaviour.
# One is if you defined an inheritance hierarchy in your code.
# Creating an instance with 'new' will make sure that
# your instantiated object properly inherits from
# its prototype. 
# [Demo] BookLogger App ...

#3 Value and Constant Services
#3a The Value Service
# The 'value' function is just shorthand for calling 
# the factory function with no parameters. 
# If you don't need to inject anything into your factory
# function you can use the value function instead. 

#3b The constant function is not a short-hand version of anything. 
# It simply registers service with injector, no factory/provider calls.
# It allows you to register an object literal function or some other constant
# with the inject, but it doesn't call the service, factory or provider methods
# behind the scenes. 

# A value service can't be injected into a module configuration function but
# a constant service can. 

# Final difference concerns decorators.  Decorators are a way to over-ride
# or modify the bahaviour of an existing service.
# Value services CAN be overridden by AngularJS decorators, but 
# constant services CANNOT. 

# The syntax for both types of service is very similar and straight-forward.
# [Demo BookLogger project] 

# Brice 'Remember services created with the value function are just thin
# wrappers around the factory function. You can use 'value' instead of 
# 'factory' if you don't need to injecct anything into the new service you
# are creating. 
#
# The object that is passed to represent the service in the example just
# has a single property, which is the retriveBadge function below 
#
angular.module('app)
    .value('badgeService, {
		    retrieveBadge: retriveBadge
		});

function retrieveBadge(minutesRead) {
  // my function stuff
	}
