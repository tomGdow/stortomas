Three components of IP NETWORK

1. Broadcast address # all 1's in host portion of ip address # last  address available
2. Host addresses    # both 1's and 0's in host portion of ip address. 
                     # very first host address is one address higher than NW address
					 # very last host address is one address lower than broadcast address
3. Network address   # all zeros in host portion of ip address # first address available

BUT we not assign network address or broadcast address to any device.
Reserved for data network to use.

Variable Lenght Subnet masking.
# Tackle the problem from number of hosts perspective, 
# rather than number of networks perspective.

To add route, need 3 pieces of info
	1. the ip address we are trying to reach
	2. the subnet mask of that address
	3. the 'next-hop' ip address

Two rules for next hop  (config static route): 
    1. When configuring router 1, the next hop ip address must be
	   part of a network directly connected to router 1. 
	   (must share a network address?) 
	  
	2. Secondly, the ip address cannot be an address on the router on   
	   which we are configuring the static route. 
	   
	Example (on cisco router)
	config t
	ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0  172.16.10.1
	exit
	show ip route # now additional route in routing table
	
	config t
	no ip route # on way
	do show run # easier way
	<ctrl-c>
	no <right-click-paste>

	# Default route is also called 'Gateway of last resort'
	
	ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.10.1 
                          # 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 means everything, in land of networking.
	ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.66
	
# Route Summarization 

Route summarization is a tool that allows us to be 
more efficient in writing static routes. 

Loopback interface is a non-dying virtual interface. 
creates an address that is still reachable when some of the interfaces on
the router is down but where the router itself is still reachable. 
Loopback: can only have a single ip attached. Always /32. But CAN
configure /24 (to pretend that there are four networks out there)

Configure loopback interfaces /32
L0 - 10.65.0.1/24
L1 - 10.65.1.1/24
L2 - 10.65.2.1/24
L3 - 10.65.3.1/24

can config (router1) as follows

ip route 10.65.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.65.16.2
ip route 10.65.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.65.16.2
ip route 10.65.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.65.16.2
ip route 10.65.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.65.16.2

11111111 11111111 11111100 00000000  /22 #255.255.252.0

10.65.0.0/22 
Range of addresses:

10.65.0.0 10.65.3.255  # The same! 

# so ..
ip route 10.65.0.0 255.255.252.0 10.65.16.2 #just 1 route. 

if conflict, router will take route with larger network portion
(largest number of bits in network portion) 

But ...
you can't always summarize

Dynamic routine chooses best path determined by metric

Two types of routing protocols
	Interior gateway routing protocols
	Exterior gateway routing protocols
	
    Interior: two categories. Ross is not a fan
	     1. Distance Vector protocol
		 2. Linked state routing protocol

Distance vector: oldest. inefficient. slow 
	advertise routing table periodically. 
	periodically sends entire routing table to all other routers to which connected. 
	eg. RIP (Routing Information Protocol) is example of distance vector protocol
	Sends out entire routing table to its neighbours every 30 seconds (whether
	it needs to or not) Advertisement sent out contain a metric. In the case of RIP
	it is hop count. Routers record interface that route was received on.  Routers do 
	not advertise out on the interface advertisment received. 
  Split horizons (prevents routing loops in distance-vector
	routing by preventing a router from advertisizing back through an interface
	from which it learned. RIP uses split horizon with poison reverse. (Do send message out
	on interface received, but poison it such that when received the other router discards)
	Examples of Distance Vector Routing: RIP (very slow, classful routing protocol).
	Cisco came up quite a long time ago with a proprietory version of RIP. Now deprecated
    but Cisco came out with Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol. EIGRP (Ross has
	a lot of respect for. Now open source) EIGRP very solid advanced distance routing
	vector protocol. 
	
	Link State Routing protocols
	Came out later. More efficient. Keep account of state of link. Routers advertise
	changes in state of link. When link-state router turns on, there is a flurry of info
	about the status of all of the 'up' links. Populates network topology table. Uses
	algorithm to build routing table. If link state changes, topology table changes and
	routing table is rebuilt. 
	Examples: Open shortest path first (OSPF)  very widely used. non-proprietory. 
	          Around for eons. Well know well supported. 
	          Intermediate system to intermediate system (IS-IS). Also well supported.
			  
			  Both about the same in terms of performance. 

			  Administrative Distance

    Route Type          Administrative Distance
	   Directly Connect          0
	   Static                    1 (Default)
	   EIGRP                     90
	   OSPF                      110
	   IS-IS                     115
	   RIP                       120

	Router may run multiple routing protocols.
    Admin distance tells router which route to add 
    to routing table. Higher the number, the less trustworthy
	admin dist chooses which routing method. but what if
	two paths? then use metric
	
	The metric
	  The cost to destination.  Gps, for example, will take into
	  account speed limits. Chooes path highest speed, not lower
	  hop count.
	  
	Routing table 
	admin distance and metric visible in routing table
	[90/15160] first number is admin distance, second is metric
	
	wildcard mask is inverse of subnet mask (substitute 1's for 0's, 0's for 1)
	
	VLANs are broadcast domains  # VLANS - virtual lans
	way  of separating broadcast domains within a single switch. 
	layer 2 frame used to make broadcast domain.
	remember: routers throw frames away. 
	token ring: ibm layer-2 protocol. Developed about 1985
