# To Encrypt
Openssl des3 < your_file_to_encrypt > your_file_to_encrypt.des3
# For example
Openssl des3 < the_riddle_of_the_sands_two > the_riddle_of_the_sands_two.des3
# Will be prompted for password

# To Decrypt
openssl des3 -d < your_encrypted_file.des3 > your_decrypted_file.txt
# For example
openssl des3 -d < the_riddle_of_the_sands_two.des3 > tomgg.txt


# Comment on SO
Why des3? You can do much better encryption faster with openssl aes-128-cbc â€“ Brendan Long
