#1 Everything in python is an object
#2 IDLE is IDE after Eric Idle of Monty Python
#3 has a  type
#4 built in fn 'type' 
#5 Two fundamental types of type
    a. Scalar. Indivisible. The 'atoms'
       int, float, boolean(true/false)
       no char. Instead has strings (str)
    b. Non-Scalar.
       Expression. An expression is a sequence of operands and operators
       The operands are objects
    "a" + "b" => ab
    The operator '+' is overloaded
    In an overloaded operator, the meaning depends on the operands.

# Floats are NOT the same as reals. They are  a computer scientists approximation
# to real numbers. Not quite the same.

# In python, a variable is simply a name for an object
# an assignment binds a name to an object

y =float(raw_input("Enter a Number: '))
