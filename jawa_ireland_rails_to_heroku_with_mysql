#Gemfile
gem 'yaml_db'
bundle install
rake db:dump

# this will create db/data.xml

# now in gemfile
#1 get rid of mysqlite gem
#2 add the following
gem 'mysql2', '~> 0.3.12'
gem 'yaml_db'

#update config/database.yml as follows
development:
  adapter: mysql2
  encoding: utf8
  reconnect: false
  database: jawa_development
  pool: 5
  username: deploy
  password: thomas

## get rid of production and test altogether!

# now
bundle install

rake db:create
rake db:schema:load
rake db:load

# See this stackoverflow question and Josef email
http://stackoverflow.com/a/1671363/499167

# Now data is loaded 
# Should be OK on localhost

# For deployment to Heroku 
# modify Gemfile as follows
gem 'rails_12factor', group: :production
# can also specify version of ruby (a goodie)
# in config/application.rb, add the following
config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

heroku create
git push heroku master
#failed!

#From Heroku website will need to active this
ClearDB MySQL :: Database  AS ADD-ON (from within your app) 
# Also from Heroku website, DELETE THE PG database for the app. 
# Josef : IMPORTANT: Login into Heroku dashboard and delete postgres database othervise you will not be able to set database url

heroku config | grep CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL

Connect to db by executing the following from command line

heroku config:set DATABASE_URL='mysql2://b31597f69b84fa:8059cd72@us-cdbr-iron-east-03.cleardb.net/heroku_d01e8bd87ddedfc?reconnect=true'

heroku run rake db:migrate

heroku rename jawaireland

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1670154/convert-a-ruby-on-rails-app-from-sqlite-to-mysql


install mysql on development server created using vagrant ( this needs to be done before adding mysql2 gem otherwise bundle install keeps failing) --> sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev

setup database and user with privileges


add gem 'mysql2', '~> 0.3.12' to Gemfile and remove gem 'sqlite3' ( https://rubygems.org/gems/mysql2/versions )




Update database.yml file

development:
  adapter: mysql2
  encoding: utf8
  reconnect: false
  database: vagrant_development
  pool: 5
  username: deploy
  password: josefzacek


follow stackoverflow link above to dump data from sqlite3, setup database.yml and load data into MySQL database

db/data.xml file created contains content form Sqlite3 and needs to be loaded into Mysql (push this to heroku as well)



HEROKU

heroku create jawa-moto-ireland



add line to Gemfile  -->  ruby '1.9.3'   (without this line heroku used ruby version 2.2.0 (which is installed on my computer but has nothing to do with jawa application ) and I think I will alway add this line to every ROR projects as it is a good idea, especially if you return to project after a couple of years)


add line to application.rb  -->    config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false
http://simonecarletti.com/blog/2012/02/heroku-and-rails-3-2-assetprecompile-error/


add -->  gem 'rails_12factor', group: :production  this is recommended by Heroku to prevent injection


bundle install


Create MySQL database
heroku addons:create cleardb:ignite


Get MySQL database url
heroku config | grep CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL


Set database url (this can also be done in Heroku app settings tab)
IMPORTANT: Login into Heroku dashboard and delete postgres database othervise you will not be able to set database url
heroku config:set DATABASE_URL='mysql2://b7fe8a861d5eb0:1ca9e81a@us-cdbr-iron-east-03.cleardb.net/heroku_44318e4e01f9d35?reconnect=true' (I'm using gem 'mysql2' so I had to add 2 after mysql as recommended in documentation  https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cleardb) 


Migrate database
heroku run rake db:migrate


Load data into databses from data.yml file 
heroku run rake db:load
