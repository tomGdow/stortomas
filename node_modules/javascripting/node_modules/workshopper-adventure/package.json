The Workshopper package itself is largely concerned with the menu system and some of the basic command-line parsing. Much of the work for executing the exercise validation is handled by [workshopper-exercise](http://github.com/rvagg/workshopper-exercise).\n\n\n### Contributors\n\n<b><code>workshopper</code></b> is proudly brought to you by the following hackers:\n\n* [@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg)\n* [@substack](https://github.com/substack)\n* [@maxogden](https://github.com/maxogden)\n* [@cjb](https://github.com/cjb)\n* [@wpreul](https://github.com/wpreul)\n* [@davglass](https://github.com/davglass)\n* [@Rowno](https://github.com/Rowno)\n* [@wilmoore](https://github.com/wilmoore)\n* [@evilpacket](https://github.com/evilpacket)\n* [@bobholt](https://github.com/bobholt)\n* [@jessmartin](https://github.com/jessmartin)\n* [@braz](https://github.com/braz)\n* [@timoxley](https://github.com/timoxley)\n* [@dominictarr](https://github.com/dominictarr)\n* [@dominhhai](https://github.com/dominhhai)\n* [@minatu2d](https://github.com/minatu2d)\n\n#### Maintainers\n\n* [@martinheidegger](https://github.com/martinheidegger)\n* [@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg)\n* [@substack](https://github.com/substack)\n* [@maxogden](https://github.com/maxogden)\n* [@cjb](https://github.com/cjb)\n* [@timoxley](https://github.com/timoxley)\n* [@dominictarr](https://github.com/dominictarr)\n* [@braz](https://github.com/braz)\n\n\n## License\n\n**Workshopper-Adventure** is Copyright (c) 2015 Martin Heidegger [@martinheidegger](https://github.com/martinheidegger) and licenced under the MIT licence.
