putty_set_up_ssh_key
#Lenovo windows 10
# allow ssh to digital ocean droplet (tomgdow@tomgdow.com) using ssh tomgdigo or ssh tomgdow@digo

download and insall putty
use keygen to generate a new key
store the PRIVATE key, nameing it id_rsa (the extension ppk will be added by putty)
There is NO NEED to store the public key locally  (it will be regenerated when you load private key)
Copy the public key and paste it into ~/.ssh/authorized_hosts on digital ocean machine
In PUTTY, add 
session/ ip-address/46.101.11.172
Data /autologin username / tomgdow
ssh -> Auth / browse to public key. 
name and save the session

IN ADDITION, in keygen  (very important) 
load key and Converions -> Export OpenSSh key > save ~/.ssh/id_rsa (NO file extension)
To get rid of passphrase requirement, use pageant (part of putty), load key (in ~/.ssh !) and add passphrase
To get rid of passphrase requirement on powershell, use
ssh-agent
ssh-add

IN ADDITION, Sept 2020, to get rid of error ssh-agent not running (Powershell)
