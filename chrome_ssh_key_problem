#  The Problem

T IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is
0d:70:0c:53:cb:0d:3d:ca:01:05:d4:3d:b3:01:9b:9a.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in /.ssh/known_hosts:2
ECDSA host key for 192.168.56.1 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
NaCl plugin exited with status code 255.
(R)econnect, (C)hoose another connection, or E(x)it?

# This command did the trick
# Execute from the Javascript console
term_.command.removeKnownHostByIndex(index)
# where 'index' was 2.
