mkdir unixtutorial && cd $_
mkdir mydir{a..c}
ls
cd mydira
touch myfile{1..10}.txt
ls
echo "Hello from myfile1" >> myfile1.txt
cat myfile1.txt
cp myfile1.txt myfile1_copy.txt
ls | grep copy
mv myfile1_copy.txt myfile1_alt.txt
ls
ls | grep copy
ls | grep alt
cp myfile1.txt ../mydirb/
mv myfile1_alt.txt ../mydirb/
cd ../mydirb && ls
echo "This is another line" >> myfile1_alt.txt 
cat myfile1_alt.txt
wc -l myfile1_alt.txt
wc -l < myfile1_alt.txt

#Set an env variable (for 'MDB' read 'my directory B')
# Make sure you are in 'mydirb' before executing next command
MDB="$(pwd)"
echo $MDB
cd  && ls

!!
cd ../mydira/

echo $MDA
cd  
# should now be in your 'home' directory
ls  $MDA/* 
cp  $MDA/* unixtutorial/mydirc/
cd unixtutorial/mydirc/ && ls

# for 'MYU' read 'MY Unix Directory'
echo $MYU
cd 
cd $MYU
rm -rf mydirb/*

## GIT PRACTICE
cd $MYU
mkdir mygit && cd $_
touch gitfile1.txt
echo "This is commit one" >> gitfile1.txt
cat gitfile1.txt
git init
git add .
git commit -am "first commit"
git status
echo "second commit" >> gitfile1.txt
cat gitfile1.txt
wc -l < gitfile1.txt
git ad..
git commit -am "second commit"
git status
git log
git checkout 21031dca3d714  ## SUBSTITUTE the first 8 or more characters of COMMIT 1 uid instead of '21031dca3d714' here
cat gitfile1.txt
wc -l < gitfile1.txt
git checkout master
cat gitfile1.txt
wc -l < gitfile1.txt

## Extra Extra
echo "Hello $(whoami)"
echo "The value of 'MYU' is  ${MYU}"
