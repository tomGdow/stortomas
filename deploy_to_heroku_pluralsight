# Samer Buna 
# Pluralsight 
# Rails 4 Getting Started.

# First thing that must be done is install Heroku toolbelt
# Now login to Heroku
# (All OK on Ubuntu VM)
# From App directory ...
heroku create
git remote -v
#(Checks all is well)

# A Few steps to do before deployment
	# The first is sqlite
	# Move sqlite to 'development and test' portion of gemfile
	# Add the following to Gemfile
	
group :production do
	gem 'pg'
	gem 'rails_12factor'
end


# Now...
bundle install
git push heroku master
# One more step
heroku run rake db:migrate
# App deployed successfully here:

#Samer Buna's deployment to Heroku available here

#Rename
heroku rename hisuniv
# Now relevant

# This worked perfectly
git clone https://git.heroku.com/hisuniv.git
# Try this to get Samer Buna's code
git clone https://git.heroku.com/secure-tundra-2349.git
# DOES NOT WORK!  No access to account.
