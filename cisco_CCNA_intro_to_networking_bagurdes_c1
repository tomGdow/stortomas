OSI model 
Open system inter-connect

designed to allow 2 devices to communicate with each other. 

7  Application 
6  XX Presentation
5  XX Sessions
4  Transport
3  Network
2  Data-Link
1  Physical

Presentation and Sessions layers NOT used anymore. 

Presentation layer history.  Was a time when computers only spoke
to one another in a certain type of encoded text.  Standard was ascii
IBM then came out with another protocol called ebcdic 
(Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code). In 1970's engineers
needs a protocol to translate ascii to ebcdic, and ebcdic to ascii, in
order to get the two devices to talk.  But now pretty much standarized. 
Encryption etc, traditionally associated with PSL, now pushed to other 
layers. 

Sessions layer used in the past for old type of firewall callled socs
netbios also an old sessions layer protocol. Not used anymore.

The layers are STILL there, just not used very much anymore. 


But ... there are other models. 

TCP/IP Model (Pretty slick)
(developed from Dept. Defence model) 

Application
Transport
Network
Network Interface

Put them side-by-side

        OSI          |  TCP/IP 
	-----------------+--------------+
	7 | Application  |              |
	--|--------------|              |
	6 | Presentation |  Application |
	--|--------------|              |
	5 | Session      |              |
	--|--------------|--------------|
	4 | Tranport     |   Transport  |
	--|--------------|--------------|
	3 | Network      |  Network     |
	--|--------------|--------------|
	2 | Data Link    |  Network-    |
	--|--------------|  interface   |
	1 | Physical     |              |
	--|--------------|--------------+

Uses only useable portions of OSI model. 
(Network -interface is one layer) 

Which one to use? OSI without the Presentation
and Sessions layer. TCP/IP model mainly academic


7. HTTP, HTTPS, Telnet, ssh, ftp, sftp, tftp,POP3, IMAP, 
SMTP, DNS etc

4. Transport layer.  Session control. 
   TCP and UDP (Firewalls are layer 4 device)
   Transport layer sets up a session between 2 devices. 
   Analogy: two people making a landline phone call.
   
3. Network layer.  Responsible for delivery of individual packets
   IP and ICMP (a subset of IP, used for Ping). IP works much like
   post office. IP responible for logically addressing each device on 
   a network with a unique address. 
   
2. Data Link Layer. Represents connections between devices themselves. 
   Lots of protocols: ethernet (wired and wireless), ATM (with fibre),
   Asynchronous transport mode. Serial (PPP)
   Addressing scheme is physical address
   Given by manufacturer Mac addresss (if using ethernet). Mac address
   some organiz, can identify manufacturer, but that is it.  Cannot 
   identify where is the world from Mac address. 

1.  Physical layer.  Move data via photons. or electrons. Fibre optics
    copper wirs. 



OSI model and encapsulation.

Encapsulation: take large chunk of data (eg Html file), break it up into
smaller pieces, and put each piece into a series of virtual envelopes, each
envelope specific to an OSI layer, then adding addressing onto the virtual envelope
(the addressing is the header) 

7 Start at Application Layer (OSI Layer 7) Eg sending a web page: a file
  Http acts at application layer. 

  +-------------------+
  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |   Html file split into smaller pieces at app layer
  +-------------------+   Each piece passed down to next layer - transport layer. 
  
 4 Transport layer 
 
   +---------------------------------------------+
      Transport layer header        |            |
	 ----------------------------   |            |
    Source    Destination  Other    |  Piece 1   |     Segment 
     port #	   port #       info    |            |
	                                |            |
   +---------------------------------------------+
   
  Source port and destionation port identify a SESSION between 2 end points. 
  An transport layer info encapsulated in segment, which is then handed down to
  network layer. Ports: 1-65535. And 1-1023 for known protocols.
  
 3 Network Layer 
 
   +---------------------------------------------+
      Network layer header          |            |
	 ----------------------------   |            |
    Source    Destination   Other   |  Segment   |     Packet  
    ip address	ip address  info    |            |
	                                |            |
   +---------------------------------------------+
 
Kind of like nesting envelopes.  Now segment sent to data-link layer

 2 Data-link layer
 
   +---------------------------------------------+//
      Data Link Layer header        |            |
	 ----------------------------   |            |
    Source    Destination   Other   |  Packet    |    Frame 
    Mac address	Mac address  info   |            |
	                                |            |
   +---------------------------------------------+
  
  Frame send down to physical layer.
  
 1 Physical layer
  Converts frame into pulses of electricity or whatever which
   are  interpreted as 1's and zeros. Reassemled at other end. 

Encapsulation is CORE of networking.    

Datagram. A generic term to refer to an encapsulated piece of data. 

TCP: Connection oriented.  Flow control, Reliable Delivery
UDP: Connectionless. Lightweight. 

# ip addresses.
  network portion and host portion
    network.host 
  
Network portion: a group of devices on a network. Like zip code
Host portion: similar to street address  123 Main street. 
              identifies individual device 

How do we identify host and network portions?

TWO WAYS
  # 1 Classful addressing  (before about 1995)
  # 2 Classless addressing (after about 1995)
  
Classful not used anymore.

# Classful.  Ingenious. Developed in 1980's

All Private Ips 

A 0.0.0.0   127.255.255.255  0   n.h.h.h  Large organization
B 128.0.0.0 191.255.255.255  10  n.n.h.h
C 192.0.0.0 223.255.255.255  110 n.n.n.h
D 224.0.0.0 239.255.255.255  1110  n.n.n.n Broadcast
E 240.0.0.0 255.255.255.255  11110 Experimental 

Multicast. Class D addresses. No hosts!! 
The internet is NOT currently multi-cast capable.

Major problem with classful addressing is that 
based on speed at which internet grew, the public
ip space set to run out in very short period of time

By 1988 ipv6 written.  Not implemented as equipment
not available. So came out with big hack
Classless ips are big hack to circumvent the problem
of running out of class 4 ip addresses. 

#Classless addressing
Uses subnet mask to determine network portion
and host portion of ip address. 
In subnet mask, put 1's in all positions of
network component of address, and all zeros
in host portion of ip address.
Subnet mask usually converted to decimal
255.255.255.0 
Use mask in conjunction with ip address to determine
where network portion and host portion of address is.

#Address Types (ipv4)
1. Network address if all zeros in host portion of address, then NETWORK address
   NW address identifies a group of hosts. 
2. Host address #  mixture of 1's and zeros in host portion of address
             # assigned to individual devices on network. 
3. Broadcast address  # if all 1's in host portion 
   Broadcast address was intended to be a way of communicating with
   all devices on the network.  Is .255 always broadcast address? 
   Absolutely not. Defn is 'all 1's in host portion of ip'
   
Private IP addresses and NAT

	10.0.0.0 -> 10.255.255.255  class A
	172.16.0.0 -> 172.31.255.255  class B
	192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.255.255  class C 

Public ips are limited. That is why giant hack of subnet mask,
to all for more ips.  One of pieces of puzzle is NAT - network
address translation.  Three ranges of ip addresses set aside
for organizations and individuals to use internally, which
would not be allowed be routed publically on internet

One range of addresses for each CLASS of address. 

One other address ...
127.0.0.1  # No place like it! # Home, of course
ip address for local device for local network. 
loop-back address. Assigned to NIC so that can reach NIC
from device itself. Ping 127.0.0.1 

Use subnet mask to identify host portion. 
Use host portion of ip address to determine type of address. 

router: transfers packets between networks.
gateway: another name for a router. (but protocols may be different?)
Default gateway: the word 'gateway' a bit unfortunate here
Used to call router a gateway. In mid-to-late 80's changed to
router. However, Microsoft, Linux and others chose to keep
the name 'Gateway'. Should be called 'default router'.
The default gateway is 'our post office'. Where we send traffic
when not on local network. Usually (almost always) the adapter
using to talk to the rest of the world. 


# change windows ip address.
# search for 'view network connections'
# Right-click on wiki -> choose properties
# ipv4(select) -> properties -> you are there! 
# very good technique 




#Netstat

netstat -an # on windows!
