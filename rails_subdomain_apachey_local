using sub.domain to access guest os apache locally

----------from above-----
I've now managed to get this working.

In case anyone ends up here wanting to do something similar...

- Set up the Guest OS with Host-Only networking.

- Look for the Guest IP (ifconfig). By default should be in the range 192.168.56.xxx

- In windows host OS hosts file add required sub.domain pointing to the discovered guest IP
so I added
192.168.56.102 local
192.168.56.102 client1.local
192.168.56.102 client2.local

Tip.  fe_sendauth: no password supplied 
In development, if getting error about pg password not being found
DELETE localhost from database.yml. 
ie delete this line altogether from development block:
host: localhost
