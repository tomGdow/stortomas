 #1
 source ~/.bashrc
 . ~/.bashrc

 exec bash

#Notes
#. is a BASH shortcut for the "source" builtin command

#source is a built-in shell command that executes the content of the file passed as argument,
#in the current shell. 
#So in your example, it executes .bashrc file in the current shell.
# And exec command replaces the shell with a given program, 
# in your example, it replaces your shell with bash (with the updated configuration files)
