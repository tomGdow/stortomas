#Marks
#Vim keeps account of a few marks for you ...
#To mark the cursor postion, type 'm' followed by letter: 'ma', 'mb'
#Jump to it later with backtick and the letter
#or, alternatively, jump to start of the line with the mark with single-quote and letter
#Lower-case marks are file-specific
#Upper-case marks are global
#Ca
#For 
d't 			Deletes from cursor position to mark t
m cursor to the end of the line

#Speedy way to avoid visual mode!
:marks			Get a list of all marks

#Vims Mark
`0-`9			The position of cursor when you exit vim
			'0 is the most recent 

``, "  			The position of the cursor before the last jump

#In Visual mode, 'o' toggles which end of selection is active
#ie, toggles cursor position between beginning and end of selection
#Extremely useful.  
#Never have to give up and reselect if starting position off by one

## SEARCH and REPLACE


/		Search forward from cursor position
?		Search backwards from cursor position
n		next match in search
N		previous match 
# The direction depends on which operator used to start the search 
*		Search forward for the curent WHOLE word
#		Search backwards for the current WHOLE  word
g*		Search forwards for curent word as PART of word
g#		Search backwoards for current word as PART of word

/h1/+3 		Put cursor on third line after section heading
/hello/e3 	Put cursor Three CHARACTERS after match
d/bacon/e	Delete text from cursor position to end of word 'bacon'
y?def		Yank (copy) text from current position to previous def

#Substitution

:[range]/s[ubstitute]/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] [count]
:%s/bacon/lettuce/gc	Replace 'bacon' with lettuce, global, confirm
#flags
c		confirm
i		ignore case
I		case-sensitive
g		global
n		show number of matches (non-destructive)
p		print matching lines
#		(alt) print matching lines

%		A leading percent searches all lines in the current buffer
%s/a/b		... for example
s/a/b		Omit '%' to search only the current line

:.,'a s/bacon/lettuce	Replace all occurences of 'bacon' with 'lettuce'
			from the current line to the 'a' MARK
.,'a			Use a range from cursor to MARK 'a'
s/a/b			Search for 'a', replace with 'b'

#Specify a line
.		Current line
+5		5 lines down
-3		3 lines up
1		Line 1 of buffer
$		Last line of buffer
%		All lines in buffer
't		Position of mark 't'
/pattern/	Next line where pattern matches
:s/bacon/lettuce/g10	Replace all occuences of 'bacon 
			with 'lettuce' within the next 10 lines only

#Sometimes easier to go into visual mode
V		Activate visual mode for full lines
25G		Takes you to line 25
#use 'o' to toggle position of cursor (end/beginning of selection) if necessary. 
#Now type a substitution command starting with a colon
## Vim gives you the range specifier which represents the selected region
#	:'<,'>  (Range specifier)
# Enter a search pattern
#	:'<,'>s/bacon/lettuce

# '%' is a shortcut for all lines in current buffer
#GLOBAL COMMAND
#can use vim's powerful global command to execute a command
#on all lines that match a pattern

#Search and Execute

:[range]g[lobal]/{pattern}/[cmd]

#GLOBAL COMMAND
#can use vim's powerful global command to execute a command
#on all lines that match a pattern
#takes a form similar to search-and-replace
#unlike search, default range is whole buffer
#Search and Execute

:[range]g[lobal]/{pattern}/[cmd]

#normal {command} Execute an extended sequence

:g/vim/p
:g/re/p			GREP!
#To show all lines matching the regular expression re
#This is where the Unix grep command got its name

#	 show matches with line numbers
p	 same as above
d	 delete matching lines
y	 yank matching lines

:g/params[:foo]/#	show lines and line numbers where
			params[:foo] occurs
:g/^$/d			delete blank lines
:g/pattern/+y		Yank line after the ones that match

#To execute command against lines that DONT match a pattern
use v instead of g

Some examples

:.,+10g/foo/d		delete matches from cursor through
			next ten lines

:.,'f+2g/foo/#		show line numbers through two lines
			after mark 'f'

:.,/bar/g/foo/d		Deletet lines through next line
			mathching bar
#Commands you can execute are not restricted to deleting and
yanking
#You can also execute normal mode commands by prefixing 
#your commamds with 'normal

:g/bacon/normal OBacon is near
#insert the line 'Bacon is near' above each line that matches 
#the word bacon. 

#Regular Expressions Vim uses in Search
#In a regular expression, some characters are literal
some are special. 
# Vim allows you to alter which is which with
# an option called Magic
# This has four levals 

Very Magic	\v	Similar to Perl, Ruby, Python
Magic		\m	The default, but awkward
No Magic	\M	Rarely used
Very No Magic	\V	Rarely used

#One area where vim's default behaviour is inconsistent and
confusing

#Invariably want Very Magic, which is similar to Perl's
#regular expression syntax
#It is NOT advisable to set this in .vimrc
#Technically you can, but vim documentation
#warns against it

#How does Magic and Very Magic differ
Very Magic	Magic
\s		\s		Whitespace	same in both
()		\(\)		Escaping        Magic only
{n, m}		\{n,m}		Quantifiers	Escape opening in						 Magic
[]		[]		Character Range No escape
*		*	
+		\+		1 or many	escape in Magic
=	        \=				Escap in Magic

#Very Magic corresponds to Unix's egrep
#Magic corresponds to Unix's grep
#Magic uses lots of backslashes inconsistently - a disaster!

#In Very Magic only literal characters are
#0-9, a-z, A-Z, and underscore 

#Turn on Very Magic with \v

#Two ways to search
/\(.y\)\{3}

/\v(.y){3}

#To repeat a search
/Ctrl-r/
#ie, Ctrl-r, FOLLOWED BY SLASH

#Ack commands in Vim

:Ack		current_user
		search all files below your working directory
:cn 		Next result
:cp		Previous result
:cc3		Display third result
:ccl		Close the Quickfix window

Advanced configuration (start)
Three basic levels of configuration
	#1 Basic Configuration
	#2 Custom key mapping
	#3 Vimscript plugins

# Mappings provide a convenient method to enter a sequence of commands
# with just a few keystrokes
# Map one set of keystrokes to another.  When vim sees the former it
# acts as if it saw the latter
#For example
:vmap > >gv
# Lets take it apart

vmap	# reassigns a key in visual mode
>	# when you type this ..
>gv	# shift text right, re-select it,
	# and go bac to visual mode

#Map Scope

nmap	# Normal mode
imap	# Insert mode
vmap	# Visual mode
map	# Normal, Visual, and operating-pending modes
map! 	# Command and insert modes

# Example
# Map tab to autocomplete in insert mode
:imap <Tab> <C-N>
:imap <S-Tab> <C-P>

# Now can use tab to bring up autocomplete and tab OR 
# shift-tab throught the options
# You can examine the value of existing mapping
# by omitting the final argument

# Remove a mapping with 'unmap'
:vunmap >
# To see all mappings for a mode
use :map, :vmap, or any other mode map specifies

# store all mappings in .vimrc 
# Safely Swap Strokes
# Safely swap colon and semicolon, say
:nnoremap :;
:noremap :;

# So what keystrokes are safe to map?
# Vim uses most of them already, so need to be careful
# This is how to decide
# Do you want to override Vim's behaviour?
	# 1 yes	 => do it!
	# 2 no   => 
	  	Do you want carpal tunnel syndrome
		  # 1 Yes	 => Map a meta key

	          # 2 No	=> Use the Leader and a single key`  
# The map leader is a character whose sole purpose is to
# prevent your mappings from conflicting with vim's commands
# Its default value is backslash,
# but can set it in .vimrc to anything you feel
# comfortable typing which does not clash
# Note that you set it differently from other options
:let mapleader=","  	# Change the personal hotkey

# Say, for example, you want to map 'Ctrl-F in insert mode
# to uppercase the word before the cursor.
# One way: map Ctrl-F directly
:map! <C-F>	<Esc>gUiw`]a
# or, if you didn't want to wipe out Vim's default Ctrl-F,
# which is scroll forward one page,
# you could take it to your leader
:map! <Leader> <Esc>gUiw`]a	# type exactly as given
# Try it in INSERT mode by typing backslash -F
\f
# A goodie!

<%= = %=>	
#Abbreviations
:iab ff firefox
iab		# Declare an abbreviation for insert mode
		# See also 'ab' for insert, Replace, and 
		# Command-line modes

#Folding

# In the classic Sci-Fi novel 'Dune' by  Frank Herbert
# people learn to travel by folding space and taking a single step
# onto another planet

# In vim can operate on a file by folding long ranges of text

# Novices use folds to put more content on the screen
# Experts use folds to perform searches or global operations on
# blocks of code as a single line
# You may find that  your mind does not naturally think in
# terms of folds.  That's OK! Some people find them indespensible
# and others don't use them at all.

# Vim Folding strategies
:set foldmethod=
	indent		# Use spaces or tars to find foldable blocks
	syntax		# Fold on language features (methods, classes)
	marker 		# Fold on textual marks
	diff		# Fold unchanged text
	expr		# Custom, code-driven folding
	manual		# Select ranges to fold

# Default is manual
# You will quickly tire of manual folding
# Dan suggests fold by syntax or indent
# Lets have a look at a Ruby file where folds are managed by
# the easiest strategy -syntax
# Will first do ineractively, but all may be stored in .vimrc files
# As permanent defaults

# 1 Syntax Folding
:set foldmethod=syntax
# or use abbreviation 'fdm'

zK	# Move up a fold
zj	# Move down a fold

xM	# Close ALL folds
xc	# Close a fold

za 	# Toggle a fold (on/off)

zo	# Open a fold
zR	# Open ALL folds

zk 	# Move back up to the end of the previous fold

zi 	# Toggles folding on/off altogether 

zx	# Reset folds, if you have 'made a pickle of things'
	# this folds everything except the fold
	# at the cursor's current line
zX	# Fold everything again

# 2 Indent folding

# A fallback is to let Vim detect blocks elegible for folding
# by using simple indentation
# Css is an example of this, which will also highlight a few problems
# that are easily fixed
# Open a css file and set the foldmethod to "indent"

:set foldmethod=indent

# Won't work as is
# Two settings are relevant

:set shiftwidth=2
:set softtabstop=2

# Some commands

shiftwidth=2	# The number of spaces inserted when
							# reindent operators or automatic indentation are used
softtabstop=2	# The number of spaces inserted when TAB is hit
:retab		# Replace all tabs with spaces in the current buffer
#Many aspects of folding are configurable
:set foldcolumn=2  
# Put into .vimrc 
paper
# Completion, Filtering, and Copying

Ctrl-n 			# Activation completion menu for multiple options
						# A goodie
            # Brings up floating window
						# Move down with Ctrl-n
						# Move up with Ctrl-p
						# Arrow keys work too
						# When desired word is highlighted,
						# hit enter or just resume typing

# Filtering
# sometimes it is worthwhile to filter text through an external program
# such as unique. 

#Create a file (spamspam.txt) containing the following
spam
spam
milk
bacon
eggs
spam

#Select all text using Visual mode  (shift-V)
#to run the filter type
!unique     					# In general, !<filter>

						# Four ways to run the unique filter on an entire buffer
ggVG!uniq
gg!uniq
:1,$!uniq
:%!uniq

# The range may be established with visual mode or by specifying a range
in command-line mode (after the colon).  

# Vim has a built on Sort command that can be used to sort
# on various parts of each line
# At its simplest, do range-sort, or range-sort! to reverse-sort
:1,$ sort

										# Automatic Indentation (Beautiful Code)
ggVG=
# An absolute goodie1
#break it down
ggVG					# Visually select the entire buffer (beginning gg to end G)
=							# Format selection.  Can be used on ANY selection
# use set shiftwidth to adjust the level of indentation

Text alignment
V:ce				# Center text on page
# break it down
V 					# Activate Visual Mode on lines (and select a region)
ce					# Center selection on screen

:.,+3ri60 		# Select from cursor to 3 lines down 
							# Right align on 60 characters wide

gQ						# Reflow paragraph to 80 characters wide
# But if you coding, it is easier just to use '='    

# Useful tip
:set paste 				# Disable automatic indentation
# Do this just before you paste
# Afterwards ...
set nopaste  			# To carry on 

# Copying, Yanking and Registers 

#Example Vim's registers are must more elaborate than the standard clipboard
# available on your standard OS
# Whenever you delete, change, search, substitute, or yank text 
# vim stores it in a register
# The register we have been using up to now is the default regiser
# There are 8 types of register
# 48 total registers
# You may delete, change, substitute, search or yank to any register

# CHOOSE A REGISTER WITH A DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
# To yank a link into the register called a, type:
"ayy
#Break it down
"a								# Use regiser a
yy								# Yank (copy) current line

"ap								# paste from resister a

# Named registers
"a-z
"A-Z 
#Uppercase registers append new text to their contexts 
"" 								# The unnamed register. Contains the last deleted text

# Whenever you delete text with 'd','c', 's' or 'x', or copy it with 'y', 

# Numbered registes 1-9 always contain the text from the last delete
# or change command, but you'll rarely use them. 

:registers				# show content of all registers

"+ 								# System clipboard

# You can repeat your last change or yank with '.'
# and you may specify a different count if you want ('2.') 

@: 								# Repeat the last COMMAND LINE COMMAND
#Break it down
@									# Exectute text as command
: 								# Use the : register as the text of the command

# Macros
#An example
qadWWPjp
# /Stop recording with q
qa								Start a recording named a
dW								# Delete a word
w									# go forward one word
p									# paste contents
j									# move down one line
q									# quit recoring

@a								# Execute a macro called a
5@a								# Do five times

# Plugins
# Vim can be extended with plugins, which are just vim scripts loaded automatically
# There are two types of plugins
global						# Used for all
filetype					# Specific to a particular type of file 

# Almost all vim plugins are releases in script section of 
# vim.org
# Most plugins are zip files which you unzip in your .vim dir
# Pathogen makes things easier
# Unzip to .vim/bundle directory
# Check out Tim Pope's plugins (author of 'pathogen',
# and many others)
