ge modifyhd xUbuntu.vdi --resize 100000
#Now over to knoppix youtube video

Mount 'ADRIANE-KNOPPIX_V7.2.0gCD-2013-07-28-EN.iso' and reboot vm
boot as knoppix
#from terminal
sudo gparted
# open up a second gparted for reference # important
# delete extended partion
# delete linux -swap
# now click on main partition and choose resize
# leave about 10MB
# Now re-create the delete partition.
# When satisfied, click green button

Note. resizing to 100000 seemed worked OK, and was picked up by
# machine manager. 
# But the change was (to 100000 from 50000) was NOT picked up from within
# gparted, or using fdisk from terminal of modified VM.
# Apart from this, everything worked perfectly.
