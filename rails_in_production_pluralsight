# Basics of the  assets pipeline module

rails server -e production 
tail -f log/production.log
#On Vm
rails s -e production -b 0.0.0.0
# Get the following error
# "ERROR RuntimeError: Missing `secret_token` and `secret_key_base` for 'production' environment, set these values in `config/secrets.yml`"
# In production see:
  secret_key_base: <%= ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"] %>


#Copy development secret key

  secret_key_base: a96c83aaeda7ae9e29d1648ef788a1719bef9f5a6fddeca4f124bc51df083c157eead5528ad81a33a43837acfb7b0b71efc605c192f0ff3ce8a445c8ab2fb4a1

# Now run sever
rails s -e production -b 0.0.0.0
# Now another error
"We're sorry. Something went wrong"
# No database, it would seem.
# Instead of create/migrate, copy existing
cp db/development.sqlite3 db/production.sqlite3
# Now app loads OK!
# But errors in console! 
# jQuery not loading, JS not loading, CSS not loading

# Take a look at
config/environments/production.rb
# Notice
  config.serve_static_files = ENV['RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES'].present?
# ie, 'serve or don't serve static files'
# Normally, want Apache or Ngin-X to do this, but here we want rails to serve those static files
#Set the above environment variable to 'true' before run server.

# From command line
export RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true
# And -one more step.  Need to precompile assets
rake assets:precompile
# now run server
rails s -e production -b 0.0.0.0
# Now app runs in production with no errors!!
# All assets are precompiles but NOT MINIFIED
# To Minify
# Change above rake command to the following
 RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile
