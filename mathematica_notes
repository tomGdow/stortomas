Because you want your rules to be evaluated in the same context as the expression you are applying them to, I don't think a real package is what you want. I think saving your rule definition in a package (.m) file without the package trimmings -- which create a new context -- will work for you.

    Make a new notebook with just one cell containing

    myRules = {a -> 2, b -> 3};

    Make the cell a initialization cell.

    Save the notebook to FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}] as myRules.m.

Now in any note book you can write

<< "myRules.m"
a + b /. myRules
