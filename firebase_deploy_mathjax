# On Firebase Site

create a new app
choose url name!
#on Unix
Some Preliminaries
npm update -g firebase-tools
firebase login

cd into app folder
Include the following in the head section
<script src="//static.firebase.com/v0/firebase.js"></script>

firebase init
#will be asked to choose an app url
firebase deploy 

#Notes
Had to put index.html in public folder within app
also added mathjax code, of course
Had mixed content problem, so used the https (rather than http) version 
of the mathjax library
