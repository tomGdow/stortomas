Experiments on digital ocean from home
# From digital ocean droplet
jupyter notebook  # running on port 9999
                  # CANNOT access from Windows Firefox on black hp 

# Option 1 Open ssh tunnel
# See here

#Expt 1a from Windows terminal, black hp, kilare -home networkd

ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:9999 tomgdow@tomgdow.com  

# now from windows firefox (black hp) 
localhost:8888   #works perfectly AND asked for password (home kildare network)

# Expt 1b From Silver ('mary') hp
# this also works perfectly from FROM GITBASH.

#Expt 1c Virtual Box
# also works a treat from VM! (home kildare network)

# to kill
local_user@local_host$ kill -15 18418

#Expt 2 Socat (Simple)
# Home Kildare network
# On Digitial Ocean  #(from black hp) 
jupyter notebook
socat TCP-LISTEN:8090,fork TCP:localhost:9999
tomgdow.com:8090  # Works on Windows browser (firefox) from black hp
                  # Works on Windows browser (firefox)  from 'mary' hp!!
                  # Works from xubuntu VM
                  
# Experiment 3 Rails and ssh
rails s  # digitial ssh -NfL localhost:8888:localhost:9999 tomgdow@tomgdow.comocean, running on port 3000, home(kildare) network

ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:3000 tomgdow@tomgdow.com  #from windows terminal on black hp

localhost:8888 # works perfectly windows browser!!

#Expt 3b  
#Same ssh command as above, except on silver('mary') hp
#Also works perfectly


Experiment 4 Jupyter notebook by ssh (ILAC centre library)
#On hp (black) in ilac centre library
#logged into digitial ocean droplet tomgdow@tomgdow.com
jupyter notebook #running on port 9999
#Back to Windows terminal (with github unix tools installed)
ssh -NfL localhost:8888:localhost:9999 tomgdow@tomgdow.com
#On Windows browser (Firefox)
localhost:8888
# Works perfectly.  


# Experiment 5  Jupyter Notebook on xUbuntu VM.  SSh from windows cmd 
# ssh from windows cmd line

ssh -NfL localhost:3000:localhost:8888 thomas@192.168.33.1

localhost:3000 from Windows browser (Firefox) 
# worked pefectly
# BUT NOTE that had to get the ip address from
# ipconfig (windows), choosing Ethernet adapter VirtualBox Host-Only Network 
 NOT from linux hostname -I on vm.
 
 Expt 5b.
 
 Tried the above command from silver ('mary') hp.  Did not work
 Connection refused.


Experiements from 'The Black Magic of ssh'

#1 From Windows command line (hp black pc)


# Experiment 2

#1 On digital ocean, start rails app (prag book store)
rails s # running on port 3000
# From Windows command line (hp black pc)
ssh -NfL 4000:localhost:3000 tomgdow@tomgdow.com
#From Windows browser (firefox)
localhost:4000 # picks up Rails app! 

# Expt 2b
# xubuntu vm, hp black pc 
ssh -NfL 4000:localhost:3000 tomgdow@tomgdow.com
# xubuntu browser (firefox)
localhost:4000  # Also picks up Rails app! 

# Expt 2c
# Silver ('Mary') hp
# Windows command line
ssh -NfL 4000:localhost:3000 tomgdow@tomgdow.com
# Windows browser (firefox)
localhost:4000   # Works perfectly. 

# Expt 2d
# Silver ('Mary') hp
# Try from xubuntu virtual machine
### could not connect. 'Unable to port forward through port 4000'


Expt 3
#hp black hp pc
# windows command line 
ssh -NfL 3000:tomgdow.com:80  tomgdow@tomgdow.com
# Windows browser (firefox)
localhost:3000
#Picks it up!!

Expt 4 ssh

ssh tomgdow.com -- hostname  ## note the spaces ## goodies 
ssh tomgdow@tomgdow.com -- ls

#Better
ssh  -t tomgdow@tomgdow.com --  "cd /home/tomgdow/git_bare_repos/mathematica_tgd_repo.git  && ls"

Expt 5 the tilde and ssh
#from within ssh session
~? #get help
~C #Open a command line.  # make sure tilde does not appear on shift-tilde, otherwise
#won't work
