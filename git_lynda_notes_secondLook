git reset

# Powerful tool to reset many commits.  Use with extreme caution 
# Allows us to specify where head pointer should point to. 
# git reset ALWAYS movees the head pinter
--soft 
    does not change staging index or working directory
-- mixed (default)
    changes staging index to match repository
    does not change working directory
--hard

    match repository

#Branching in Git

# branches are cheap! Can try new ideas
# isolate features or sections of work
# still One working directory
# when switch branches git does fast context switching

# when make new branh HEAD stil point to tip of master branch
# it is only when we make chanes to the new branch that HEAD changes.

git branch #Shows a list of branches
# asterisk signifies current branch
# Head always points to the tip of a branch
git branch new_feature
git checkout new_feature

cat .git/HEAD

check checkout -b  # create a new branch AND checkout
git checkout  -b shorten_title
#git checkout basically says 'put this in my  working directory'
# can of course also check out a file

#Working directory must be clean (or,strictly, almost clean) to switch branches

# if not can git add --all 
  - or can checkout the file  (git checkout --file)
  - or you can stash the changes.
  
 # 'mostly clean' means should be no conflicts!
 # Nothing there that allows you to lose data
 
 #Compare branches
 
git diff master..new_feature
git diff --color-words master..new_feature
#passing in tree-ish
#can also
git diff --color-words master..new_feature^

## To find out if a branch contains another branch or not
# That is, whether or not everything in it has been merged into current branch

git branch --merged
# will show all branches that are COMPLETELY INCLUDED in the current branch. 

# Renaming Branches

git branch -m new_feature seo_title
git branch --move new_feature seo_title  #  move.  The same as unix!

#Deleting branches

git branch branch_to_delete
git branch -d branch_to_delete

# Cannot delete a checked out branch
# Cannot delete a branch that is not fully merged
# but CAN delete with -D option.

# Merging branches
git merge seo_title
git diff master..seo_title  # Now no difference

# ALWAYS run merge with clean working directory 

# Difference between fast-forward merges and real merges
# This is that was not in last eg.  No changes to master.
# As result, did fast-forward merge. 
# Checks for Head in ancestors. If there, just fast-forward merge

git merge --no-ff branch  # forces a merge-commit. Will create a new commit message
git merge --ff-only 

Conflict in Merge

#1 abort merge
#2 resolve conflict manually
#3 use merge tool

git merge --abort

# resolve manually
#add and commit result
<<<<<< HEAD
>>>>>>
# can INSPECT changed doc in browser after changes in merge
# THEN commit. ie can view in middle of merge. 

# Tips
# keep lines short
# keep commits small and focused
# beware stray edits to whitespace
# merge often
# track changes to master (keep your branch in sync)


# have
[branch "master"]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/master
# This is what -u option gives us

git push origin non_tracking

# no listing in .git/config

# If non-tracking branch and want to make make tracking
# Three options (video 6, remotes, 3 min)  
   #1 Add relevant lines to .git/config
   #2 git config branch.non_tracking.remote origin
      git config branch.non_tracking.merge refs/heads/master
   #3 Version of git > 1.7
      git branch --set-upstream non-tracking origin/non_tracking
      
git diff master..origin/master

git diff origin/master..origin

git push origin master
# but because tracking branch
git push 
# very convenient
git log --oneline origin/master

# Fetch changes
# origin/master does NOT necessarily reflect what is on remote
# have to do a sync (not true on lynda repo in example)

git log --online -5 origin/master
# Does NOT go out remotely to look
# looking at local copy that lynda has.

git fetch origin
git fetch # knows 
# this DOES go out, 
# and syncs with local origin
# now 
git log --oneline origin/master
# changes in remote repo are reflected.
# but if you look at 
git log --oneline -5 master.
# changes are NOT reflected.
# This is important point
# When we do fetch, origin/master syncs with remote
# but 'master' does not update at all
# A fetch is no harm whatsoever

# Guidelines
    #1 Always fetch before you work
    #2 Fetch before you push
    #3 fetch often 

# Merging in fetched changes

# origin/master is just a branch line any other
# cannot checkout, but otherwise identical 

remote server: master

my computer origin/master 
            master 

git diff master..origin/master

git merge origin/master
git log --oneline master
#When we merge, we merge with origin/master,
the LOCAL copy

# shortcut
git pull = git fetch + git merge 

# Super-convenient
# Hard to understand if something goes wrong.

# Checkout remote branches. 

# remote branches like ordinary branches but cannot checkout
# but can create branch from it

git branch non_tracking HEAD
git branch non_tracking origin/non_tracking

git branch -d non_tracking

git checkout -b non_branching origin/non_tracking

git checkout master

# Push to an updated remote branch
# git never merges during push 
# do a fetch
git merge origin/master 
# now push again 
# will need to resolve conflicts (Most cases not)

# if cannot push to remote,
# need to fetch, merge and then push again.

# Delete a remote branch 

#1 older way
git push origin :non-tracking  #colon has effect of deleting branch

# what is colon all about
# Previously 

git push origin non_tracking   # to 'push'
#Actually a shortcut for
git push orign non_tracking:non_tracking
#So when doing delete, saying push nothing to remove non_tracking

#2 More intuitive way

git push origin --delete non_tracking

# Enable collaborators 

#1 fork to your github
#2 Put in a pull request
